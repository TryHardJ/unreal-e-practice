# unreal-e-practice

This is my first time using Unreal Engine. I wanted to create a short ball game that loops through levels every time the player passes the trigger point.
I picked unreal engine and avoided blueprint as much as possible so I could challenge my C++ skills and dive deep into the engines source code. 
The path to the source code is Game/Unreal/Source/MyProject

Video of my game ....
